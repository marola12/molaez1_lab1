<p> Hello! My name is Maritzha Olaez, and a few fun facts about me is that I love the 
    color green, I like to go to the gym, and my favorite animal is monkeys.
</p>
<p> I am currently studying to receive my bachlors degree in Information Technology and Management 
    and I am very excited to keep learning more. 
</p>
<p> Previously, I went to high school at John Hancock High School, where I graduated in 2024 and I met a lot of amazing people 
    there.
